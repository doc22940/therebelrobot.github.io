## About

A self-taught software engineer, I am passionate about learning and implementing stable, modern code.
I'm active in various volunteer organizations, such as the Node.js Website Working Group and
Code for San Francisco's Website and Tools Team. An avid advocate for
Open Source, I've published numerous active NPM modules, and am constantly looking for
more projects to chip in on. I know where I got my start, so I strive to help new-comers to the development
world get their bearings, while trying to push for an increased awareness of the social impact of coding.

I guess you can say I want to save the world with code.

## About

A self-taught software engineer, I am passionate about learning and implementing stable, modern code.
I'm active in various volunteer organizations, such as Code for San Francisco's Website and Tools Team. 
I am an avid advocate for Open Source, I've published numerous active NPM modules, and am constantly looking for
more projects to chip in on. I know where I got my start, so I strive to help new-comers to the development
world get their bearings, while trying to push for an increased awareness of the social and civic impact of 
coding. I know that code can't solve everything, but I intend to use my skills the best I can to help others.

<h5 class="callout">
I firmly believe we, as developers, owe a debt to the society which created us.

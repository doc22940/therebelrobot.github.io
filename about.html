## About

A self-taught software engineer, I am passionate about learning and implementing stable, modern code.
I've been active in various volunteer organizations, serving as team lead for Code for San Francisco's 
Website and Tools Team, facilitating the Node.js Website Working group for over 6 months, and spearheading
Brigadehub, a proposed CMS for Code for America volunteer brigades. I am an avid advocate for Open Source, 
I've published numerous active NPM modules, and am constantly looking for more projects to chip in on. 
I know where I got my start, so I strive to help new-comers to the development world get their bearings, 
while trying to push for an increased awareness of the social and civic impact of coding. I know that 
code can't solve everything, but I intend to use my skills the best I can to help others.

<h5 class="callout">
I firmly believe we, as developers, owe a debt to the society which created us.
